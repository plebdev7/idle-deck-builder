## Overview

Resource generation in this game is a **deck building strategy**. Specific cards generate resources when drawn during combat. Deck composition determines income rate, making resource generation a strategic deck-building decision.

---

## Critical Economy Model: Split Resources

**Two Distinct Resource Types:**

### Essence (Pack Currency)

- Generated by drawing generator cards during combat
- Used for purchasing packs, conversions, universal upgrades
- Persists between enemies
- Resets only on player death

### Shards/Fragments (Upgrade Currency)

- Dropped by combat victories
- Used for card upgrades, deck size increases, permanent upgrades
- Completely separate from essence generation

---

## Resource Generation Mechanics

### Core Mechanic

**CRITICAL:** Generators produce essence **when drawn** during combat, not passively while sitting in deck.

**How It Works:**
- When a generator card is drawn from deck during combat, it adds to your generation rate
- Example: Draw "Arcane Conduit" (+2 Essence/sec) → Generation rate increases by +2/sec
- Draw another generator → Rate accumulates (now +5/sec total)
- Generation rate persists between enemies
- Rate resets only on player death/defeat
- Longer combat sessions = more deck cycles = more generator draws = more essence accumulated

### Strategic Implications

- Generators must be in deck AND drawn to produce essence
- Deck cycling speed matters (faster draws = faster essence accumulation)
- Death has meaningful penalty (lose accumulated generation rate)
- Session length matters (playing longer = more draws = more essence)
- Need balance: generators for essence vs combat cards for victory speed

---

## Resource Generation Cards

### Arcane Generators (Foundation)

**Pure Arcane Generators:** Cards that generate Arcane Essence when drawn

- Example: "Arcane Conduit" - +2 Arcane Essence/second when drawn
- These are the foundation of the entire economy
- Available from Arcane packs
- Remain valuable throughout entire game

**Key Point:** All Essence generation starts with Arcane Essence.

### Elemental Converters (Transformation)

**Elemental Generator Cards:** Cards that CONVERT Arcane Essence → Elemental Essence

- Example: "Flame Transmuter" - Consumes 3 Arcane Essence, generates +2 Fire Essence/second
- Function as "converters" rather than pure generators
- Conversion rate is key balance point
- May have combat stats (Hybrid Converters) or pure conversion (Weak combat, strong conversion)

### Hybrid Cards

Cards that generate resources AND have combat abilities

- Example: "Victory Harvest" - +5 Arcane Essence per battle won + combat ability
- Battle rewards as resource generation
- Scales with combat performance

### Conditional Generators

Cards that generate based on game state or combos

- Example: "Elemental Resonance" - While in deck, each Fire card boosts Arcane generation by +1/second
- Synergy-based generation
- Rewards thoughtful deck composition

## Resource Flow Model

### Essence Flow (Pack Currency)

```
Draw Generator Cards → Accumulate Essence Generation Rate
                              ↓
                    Generate Arcane Essence (per second)
                              ↓
                    Spend on Arcane Packs
                    OR Spend on Universal Upgrades
                    OR Convert via Elemental Converters
                              ↓
Elemental Converter Cards → Convert Arcane → Elemental Essence
                              ↓
                    Spend on Elemental Packs
                    OR Spend on Tier-Specific Upgrades
```

### Shard Flow (Upgrade Currency)

```
Combat Victories → Drop Shards/Fragments
                              ↓
                    Spend on Card Upgrades
                    OR Spend on Deck Size Increases
                    OR Spend on Permanent Upgrades
```

### Two Distinct Progression Paths

- **Collection Path:** Generators → Essence → Packs → More cards
- **Power Path:** Combat cards → Faster victories → Shards → Stronger cards

---

## Arcane Essence as Universal Currency

### Economy Model

- **Arcane Essence:** Used for universal upgrades (card leveling, prestige upgrades, deck size increases, Arcane packs)
- **Elemental Essences:** Used for tier-specific packs and possibly tier-specific upgrades
- **Conversion Mechanic:** Generator cards convert Arcane Essence → Elemental Essence as their primary function

### Critical Design Insight

Elemental Essences may ONLY be generated through conversion. Direct elemental generation may not exist. This means:

- All economy starts with Arcane Essence generation
- Elemental generator cards function as "converters" (consume Arcane, produce Elemental)
- Resource flow: Generate Arcane → Convert to Elemental → Buy Elemental packs
- Arcane generation remains foundational throughout entire game

### Rationale

- Supports "Arcane as foundational magic" theme perfectly
- Arcane Essence always valuable at any stage of game
- Creates strategic choices: spend on upgrades vs convert to elemental
- Unified economy model with clear resource flow
- Generator cards become "conversion specialists" rather than pure generators

---

## Scaling Mechanisms

### Card Leveling

Upgrade cards to increase generation/conversion rates

### Card Quantity

Number of generator cards in deck affects total generation

### Synergies

Cross-tier synergies can boost resource generation

### Conversion Efficiency

Higher tier/level converters have better conversion rates

---

## Strategic Implications

### Arcane Generators are Critical

Without them, no resources flow

### Conversion Rate Decisions

Spend Arcane on upgrades vs convert to Elemental?

### Deck Balance

Must include Arcane generators + Elemental converters + Combat cards

### Progression Gates

Can't progress to new tier without efficient conversion

### Foundation Never Obsolete

Arcane generation remains valuable forever

## Resource Generation Rates (To Be Balanced in Session 4)

**Baseline Values (From Session 1.3):**

- **Arcane Generation:** Base rate to be determined (e.g., 1-5 Essence/second early game)
- **Conversion Rates:** To be balanced (e.g., 3:1, 5:2, etc.)
- **Deck Composition:** Optimal ratio of Generators:Converters:Combat to be tested

See [baseline-numbers.md](baseline-numbers.md) for detailed specifications.
