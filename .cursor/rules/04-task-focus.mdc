# Task Focus & Scope Discipline

## Stay On Task

- Work on ONLY the current task as defined in CHECKLIST.md or user instruction
- Complete the current task fully before moving to the next one
- Do not jump ahead to future tasks, even if they seem related or "easy"
- Resist the urge to "prepare" or "set up" for future work

## Scope Boundaries

- Respect the boundaries of the current task
- Do not expand scope without explicit user approval
- Additional work suggestions must be presented to user, not automatically implemented
- If you identify work beyond current scope, note it in the log but do not execute it

## Completion Criteria

Before considering a task complete:
- All stated objectives for the task are met
- Validation checks have passed
- Work is documented in the task log
- User has confirmed completion if task required decisions
- CHECKLIST.md item is ready to be marked complete

## Preventing Scope Creep

- Question yourself: "Is this work part of the current task?"
- If work is "nice to have" but not required, defer it
- Present scope expansion suggestions to user rather than implementing
- Keep task boundaries clear and enforced

## Task Transition Protocol

When transitioning between tasks:
- Explicitly mark the current task as complete in logs and todos
- Summarize what was accomplished
- Present the next task clearly before starting it
- Ensure clean separation between task contexts

## Related Work Handling

If you identify work related to future tasks:
- Document it in the current task log as a note
- Do NOT implement it preemptively
- Present it to the user as future consideration
- Wait for explicit instruction to proceed with related work
