# Work Tracking & Logging System

## Task-Based Log Files

- Create a separate log file for each ROADMAP/CHECKLIST task in `.cursor/log/`
- Use naming convention: `session-X-Y-task-name.md` (e.g., `session-1-1-theme-selection.md`)
- Log files must use the structured template from `log-template.md`
- All work must be logged as it is performed, not retroactively

## Required Log Entry Structure

Each log entry MUST include:
- **Timestamp**: ISO format with date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
  - Use the `get_timestamp` MCP tool from agent-utils server (default format)
  - Example: `get_timestamp()` returns current time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
- **Task Reference**: Specific CHECKLIST.md and/or ROADMAP.md item numbers
- **Files Impacted**: Complete list of all files read, modified, created, or deleted
- **Actions Taken**: Detailed description of what was done and why
- **Validation Status**: How the work was validated (tests, checks, reviews)
- **Decisions Made**: Any design or implementation decisions with rationale
- **User Confirmations**: Record of any user approval or feedback received

## Cross-Referencing Requirements

- Each log entry must be traceable to CHECKLIST.md items
- Link related log entries together for complex tasks
- Maintain an index of which files were affected by which tasks
- Enable reconstruction of work history from logs alone

## Proof-Based Delivery

- Every deliverable must have corresponding log evidence
- Include validation results in log entries
- Document how completion criteria were met
- Provide concrete evidence rather than assertions
- Link log entries to actual file changes

## Log Maintenance

- Keep logs updated throughout task execution, not just at the end
- Create log file at task start, update throughout, finalize at completion
- Never delete or significantly alter historical log entries
- Add corrections or updates as new entries, preserving original context
