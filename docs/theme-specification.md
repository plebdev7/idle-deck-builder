## Narrative Context (Minimal)

### Background (Optional Flavor)
*The tower has stood for centuries, a beacon of magical learning and power. But the barriers between worlds have weakened, and now creatures from beyond assault the tower day and night. As an apprentice, you must master the elemental arts to defend the tower and discover what lies behind the endless invasion.*

### Progression Narrative

- **Mid Game:** Mastering your chosen element, discovering new magical paths
- **Late Game:** Combining multiple elements, achieving archmage status
- **Endgame:** Transcending mortal limits, exploring forbidden magics

### Combat Context
- **Why constant combat?** The invasion never stops
- **Why auto-battle?** Your tower's defenses work automatically
- **Why deck building matters?** You're programming your tower's defensive spells
- **Why prestige?** Transcend and rebuild from a higher plane of understanding
