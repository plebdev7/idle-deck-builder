# Task Log Template

Use this template for all task-based log files in `.cursor/log/`.

**Timestamp Format:** All timestamps should use the `get_timestamp()` MCP tool from agent-utils server, which returns timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format (local time).

**Naming Convention:** `session-X-Y-task-name.md`
- X = Session number from ROADMAP.md
- Y = Task number within session
- task-name = Brief descriptive name

**Example:** `session-1-1-theme-selection.md`
