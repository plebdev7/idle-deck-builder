# Decision Validation & User Confirmation

## Check Before Acting

- Verify that each step follows logically from the previous one
- Ensure all work aligns with DESIGN.md principles and ROADMAP.md goals
- Validate that proposed changes solve the actual problem
- Cross-check decisions against existing design documentation

## User Confirmation Requirements

- Seek explicit user confirmation BEFORE making significant decisions
- Significant decisions include:
  - Answering any "Outstanding Design Questions" from DESIGN.md
  - Choosing between multiple valid implementation approaches
  - Making architectural or structural changes
  - Deviating from ROADMAP.md or CHECKLIST.md plans
  - Introducing new systems, patterns, or dependencies

## Present Before Deciding

When user input is needed:
- Clearly articulate the decision point and why it matters
- Present options with pros/cons for each
- Explain implications and trade-offs
- Provide a recommendation with reasoning
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

## Validation Methodology

- Ask yourself: "Does this make sense in the larger context?"
- Check for consistency with existing decisions
- Verify alignment with project principles and vision
- Consider edge cases and potential problems
- Document the validation process in the task log

## Decision Documentation

- Record ALL decisions made (both user-approved and autonomous)
- Include the reasoning behind each decision
- Document alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Note any assumptions or uncertainties
- Link decisions to their outcomes for future reference

## Prevent Assumptions

- Do not assume user intent without confirmation
- Do not make decisions based on "typical" patterns if context is unclear
- When in doubt, ask rather than assume
- Challenge your own assumptions before proceeding
