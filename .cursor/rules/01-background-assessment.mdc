# Background Assessment & Comprehension

## Before Starting Any Task

- Read and comprehend ALL relevant existing files before making any changes
- Always review CHECKLIST.md, ROADMAP.md, and DESIGN.md to understand current project state
- Identify which specific files will be impacted by the planned work
- Document your understanding of the current state before proceeding

## Impact Assessment Requirements

- Create a clear list of files that will be modified, created, or deleted
- Identify dependencies and relationships between affected files
- Consider ripple effects: how changes in one file might affect others
- Document the assessment in the task log before making changes

## Validation Before Action

- Confirm your understanding of the task and its scope
- Verify that you have read all necessary context
- Ensure you understand the "why" behind the task, not just the "what"
- Do not proceed until you can articulate the purpose and impact of the work

## Cross-Reference Requirements

- Link task work to specific CHECKLIST.md items
- Reference corresponding ROADMAP.md sessions and goals
- Ensure alignment with DESIGN.md principles and decisions
- Maintain traceability from task to outcome

## Design Document Integrity Check

Before implementation, verify design documents are internally consistent:

**Check For:**
- Mathematical correctness of formulas and calculations
- Arithmetic accuracy of stated totals vs components
- Contradictions between different sections
- Examples matching specifications
- Missing critical information needed for implementation

**If You Find Errors:**
- STOP before beginning implementation
- Document all errors and contradictions
- Present to user with proposed corrections
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding

**Never:**
- Begin implementation knowing design docs contain errors
- Work around design problems silently
- Assume errors are intentional without confirmation
