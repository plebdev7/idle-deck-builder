## Core Economy Model

### Split Resource System (Session 1.3 Decision)

Two distinct currencies with different purposes:

**Essence (Pack Currency):**
- Generated by drawing generator cards during combat
- Used for: Buying packs, conversion to elemental essence, universal upgrades
- Primary progression path: Collection growth

**Shards/Fragments (Upgrade Currency):**
- Dropped by combat victories
- Used for: Card upgrades, deck size increases, permanent upgrades
- Primary progression path: Power growth

---

## Generator Mechanics (Critical)

### How Generators Work

**Key Mechanic:** Generators produce essence when DRAWN, not passively.

**Flow:**
1. Generator card is drawn from deck during combat
2. Card adds to your current generation rate (+X Essence/sec)
3. Rate accumulates as more generators are drawn
4. Generation continues until death/defeat
5. On death: Generation rate resets to 0

**Example:**
```
Time 0s:   Generation rate = 0/sec
Time 1s:   Draw "Arcane Conduit" (+2/sec) → Rate = 2/sec
Time 3s:   Draw "Essence Flow" (+3/sec) → Rate = 5/sec
Time 8s:   Deck reshuffles, draw "Arcane Conduit" again → Rate = 7/sec
Enemy defeated: Rate persists (still 7/sec)
Player dies: Rate resets to 0/sec
```

### Strategic Implications

**Deck Composition Tension:**
- More generators = Faster essence accumulation = More packs
- More combat cards = Faster victories = More shards
- Must balance both for optimal progression

**Deck Cycling Speed:**
- Faster draw = More generator draws per minute = More essence
- Smaller decks cycle faster
- Draw speed becomes important upgrade path

**Death Penalty:**
- Lose accumulated generation rate
- Must rebuild rate from 0
- Makes survival valuable beyond just winning

**Session Length:**
- Longer play = More deck cycles = More generator draws
- Idle-friendly: Can accumulate essence while watching combat
- Active-friendly: Can optimize deck during play

## Resource Flow

### Essence Flow (Collection Path)

```
Combat Active
    ↓
Cards Draw from Deck at Fast Intervals (0.5-1 sec)
    ↓
Generator Cards Add to Generation Rate
    ↓
Essence Accumulates Per Second (based on rate)
    ↓
Spend Essence on Packs
    ↓
Get New Cards
    ↓
Improve Deck (add better generators or combat cards)
    ↓
Loop continues
```

**Arcane Tier (First 30 Minutes):**
- Generator cards produce Arcane Essence
- Arcane Essence buys Arcane Packs
- Arcane Packs contain more Arcane cards

**Post-Prestige (Elemental Tiers):**
- Converter cards: Consume Arcane Essence → Produce Elemental Essence
- Elemental Essence buys Elemental Packs
- Must maintain Arcane generators as foundation

### Shard Flow (Power Path)

```
Combat Victory
    ↓
Shards/Fragments Drop
    ↓
Accumulate Shards
    ↓
Spend on Upgrades:
    - Card level increases (better stats)
    - Deck size increases (more card slots)
    - Permanent upgrades (draw speed, starting resources, etc.)
    ↓
Deck becomes more powerful
    ↓
Faster victories = More shards
    ↓
Loop continues
```

## Pack System

### Pack Costs (Session 1.3 Decision)

**Scaling Formula:** `BaseCost × 1.5^PackNumber`

**Sequence:**
```
Pack 1:  50 Essence
Pack 2:  75 Essence (50 × 1.5^1)
Pack 3:  113 Essence (50 × 1.5^2, rounded to 110)
Pack 4:  169 Essence (50 × 1.5^3, rounded to 165)
Pack 5:  253 Essence (50 × 1.5^4, rounded to 245)
...
```

**Rationale:**
- Creates natural pacing (can't spam packs endlessly)
- Prevents runaway feedback loop (more generators → more packs → more generators...)
- Makes each pack feel earned
- Generators become more valuable over time

### Pack Contents

**Standard Packs (Random):**
- 5 cards per pack
- Rarity distribution (TBD in Session 2):
  - Common: 60-70%
  - Rare: 25-30%
  - Epic: 5-10%
  - Legendary: 1-5%

**Guaranteed Packs (First 2 Only):**

**Pack 1 (First Pack):**
- 2 Generator cards (ensure economy starts)
- 2 Combat cards (ensure combat power)
- 1 Utility card (introduce variety)
- All Common rarity

**Pack 2 (Second Pack):**
- 1 Generator card
- 3 Combat cards (more options)
- 1 Rare Synergy card (introduce combos)

**Pack 3+:**
- Fully random based on rarity distribution
- Excitement and variety

## First 30 Minutes Economy

### Starting State

**Starter Deck (8 cards):**
- 2-3 Generator cards (basic Arcane generators)
- 4-5 Combat cards (basic attack/defense)
- 1 Utility card (introduces special abilities)

**Starting Resources:**
- 0 Arcane Essence
- 0 Shards
- 0 generation rate (must draw generators first)

### Expected Progression

**Minutes 0-5: Bootstrap Phase**
- Generation rate: 0 → 2-4/sec (as generators are drawn)
- Essence accumulated: ~40-60 (mix of generation + victory drops)
- Shards: ~15-25 (from 3-4 victories)
- Goal: Reach 50 Essence for first pack

**Minutes 5-12: Discovery Phase**
- First pack opened (+5 cards)
- Generation rate: 2-4 → 4-7/sec (if generators added to deck)
- Essence accumulated: ~40-60 more
- Shards: ~30-50 total
- Goal: Build better deck, reach second pack

**Minutes 12-20: Growth Phase**
- Second pack opened (+5 cards, 18 total)
- Generation rate: 4-7 → 6-10/sec (optimized deck)
- Essence accumulated: ~70-100 (faster with better generators)
- Shards: ~50-80 total
- Goal: Optimize deck, approach capacity

**Minutes 20-30: Mastery Phase**
- Third pack opened (+5 cards, 23 total)
- Fourth pack potentially reached (if efficient)
- Generation rate: 6-10 → 8-15/sec (fully optimized)
- Essence accumulated: Variable (depends on optimization)
- Shards: ~80-120 total
- Goal: Full deck (20 cards), glimpse future systems

### Pacing Goals (To Be Validated in Part B)

**Pack Opening Cadence:**
- Pack 1: Minute 6 (~6 minutes)
- Pack 2: Minute 12-14 (~6-8 minutes)
- Pack 3: Minute 20-22 (~8-10 minutes)
- Pack 4: Minute 28-30+ (~8-10+ minutes)

Natural slowing due to cost scaling, but not punishing.

---

## Balance Considerations (For Part B)

### Generator Card Rates

**Too Low (<1 Essence/sec per card):**
- Progression feels slow
- Frustrating early game
- Pack opening takes too long

**Too High (>5 Essence/sec per card):**
- Runaway progression even with cost scaling
- Too easy to spam packs
- Combat becomes irrelevant

**Sweet Spot: 2-3 Essence/sec per basic generator**
- Feels impactful when drawn
- 2-3 generators in deck = meaningful income
- Scales well with cost increases

### Shard Drop Rates

**Considerations:**
- Need enough shards for meaningful upgrades by minute 30
- Should feel like secondary progression (not dominant)
- Balance: Essence for breadth (more cards), Shards for depth (better cards)

**Possible Ranges:**
- Small victories: 3-5 shards
- Medium victories: 8-12 shards
- Large victories: 15-20 shards
- First 30 minutes total: 80-150 shards

### Deck Cycling Speed

**Assumptions:**
- Card draw interval: 0.5-1 second
- 8-card starter deck
- Full cycle: 4-8 seconds
- 20-card optimized deck
- Full cycle: 10-20 seconds

**Impact:**
- 8-card deck: 7-15 cycles per minute → 14-45 generator draws/minute
- 20-card deck: 3-6 cycles per minute → 6-18 generator draws/minute
- Larger decks = slower essence accumulation (but more combat power)

### Enemy Pacing

**Goals:**
- Enough victories for shard income
- Not overwhelming (no failure in first 30 minutes)
- Difficulty scales gradually

**Possible Timing:**
- Enemy interval: 10-15 seconds
- Enemies per minute: 4-6
- 30 minutes = 120-180 enemies
- Actual victories: ~100-150 (assuming ~80% win rate, improving to 100% by minute 20)

---

## Baseline Numbers (Part B - COMPLETE & CORRECTED)

**Design Decision:** Stacking mechanic + Integer rates + Moderate-high pack costs

**CRITICAL:** Generators stack on EVERY draw, including duplicates

### Core Timing
- **Card draw speed:** 1.0 seconds per card (60 cards/min)
- **Enemy interval:** 12 seconds (5 enemies/minute)
- **Combat resolution:** Instant

### Generator Rates (STACKING - Every Draw Adds)
- Starter: **+1, +2 Essence/sec per draw**
- Pack 1: **+3, +4 Essence/sec per draw**
- Pack 2: **+5 Essence/sec per draw**
- Random Common: **+2 to +4 per draw**
- Random Rare: **+5 to +7 per draw**
- Random Epic: **+10+ per draw**

### Rate Progression (with stacking)
- Minutes 0-8: 0 → 180 Essence/sec
- Minutes 8-17: 180 → 652 Essence/sec
- Minutes 17-27: 652 → 1,252 Essence/sec
- Minutes 27-30: 1,252 → 1,500 Essence/sec

### Pack Costs
- Formula: **40,000 × 2.5^(n-1)**
- Pack 1: **40,000 Essence**
- Pack 2: **100,000 Essence**
- Pack 3: **250,000 Essence**
- Pack 4: **625,000 Essence**
- Pack 5: **1,562,500 Essence**

### Shard Drops
- Early game (0-10 min): 2-3 Shards per victory
- Mid game (10-20 min): 4-6 Shards per victory
- Late game (20-30 min): 8-12 Shards per victory
- Total by minute 30: ~875 Shards

### Enemy Stats
- Base health: 20 HP
- Scaling: 1.15^(EnemyNumber)
- Enemy 30: ~300 HP
- Enemy 150: ~30,000 HP
- Attack: 0 (early) → 5-15 (mid) → 20-50 (late)

### Combat Card Stats
- Starter: 8-10 Attack, 2-10 Defense
- Pack 1: 12-18 Attack, 5-12 Defense
- Pack 2: 20-30 Attack, 8-15 Defense
- Rare/Epic: 50-150 total stat points

### Validation
✓ Pack 1 at minute 8-9
✓ Pack 2 at minute 16-17
✓ Pack 3 at minute 26-27
✓ Pack 4 at minute 32-35 (creates long-term goal)
✓ Generation rate: 0 → 180 → 652 → 1,252 → 1,500 Essence/sec
✓ Evenly distributed pacing (pack every ~8-10 minutes)
